There are two versions of my code, both coded in C++ as a console application, using Visual Basic and each labelled accordingly.
They are both included in the source files by default, so to run either one simply remove (do not delete) the one you wish to run first.
Then add the other one back and remove the first when you wish to run that one.
The 'Solution with map' runs independently.
The 'Solution with file' has a text file included which is positioned and ready to be used.
This text file may be edited to add new items that the code will function with if it's written in the correct format.
Iteam_ID,Price,Discount_Quantity,Save_Free,Discount     
Where Discount_Quantity is how many are required to be bought to apply the discount
And where Save_Free is one of those two words (lowercase) indicated the type of offer. Save means buy a certain amount for a separate price and Free means buy x get y free offer
Open it with the most recent version of Visual Basic (as outdated ones may not support it fully) and start it without debugging.
